# Machine-Learning-CS-584-Group-8 - Melanoma Classification

Overall, people who are suffering from an illness, whether serious or light, will have a better chance of overcoming it the earlier they are diagnosed. In the case of cancer, this constant is even greater, it is a disease with high morbidity and any help that leads to early diagnosis is welcome and of vital importance. In these times, the weight of computers and artificial intelligence algorithms is growing every day, so they must be used in a way that can help the health of any person.

In the medical field, a professional can diagnose a melanoma to a patient by observing a spot, mole or mark and comparing it with other spots on the patient's skin through medical knowledge. In the field of machine learning, a machine through an algorithm may be able to predict a melanoma by learning the patterns of an image in which a melanoma can be seen.

This research focuses on the early detection of melanoma through a classification algorithm based on convolutional neural networks. Both medical professionals and machines may encounter a common problem in melanoma diagnosis. The problem is that there are many spots or moles on the skin that may be possible melanomas. In the data realm, this is known as imbalanced data and is one of the challenges facing this research.

The model created in this research based on convolutional neural networks aims to learn those details of melanomas in order to make a better prediction of them. For this purpose, several hidden layers are included to add complexity to the model. The results show that the accuracy of the melanoma class has been prioritized, since it is considered better to diagnose a melanoma when it does not really exist, than not to diagnose a melanoma when it does exist.
